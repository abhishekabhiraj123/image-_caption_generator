## Installation

To run the tool, you will need to set up the required environment and libraries. The tool has been developed using Flask, a popular web application framework in Python. The tool also utilizes pre-trained models from Hugging Face, a popular repository for NLP models.

## Setting up the environment

* Clone the repository to your local system
* Create a virtual environment using virtualenv or conda
* Activate the virtual environment
* Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the tool

* Navigate to the project directory
* Run the command python app.py in the terminal
* Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000
* Upload an image and click on the 'Generate Captions' button to get the AI-generated captions for the image.

## Libraries used

The following libraries have been used in this project:
* Flask: A web application framework in Python
* Pillow: A Python Imaging Library for handling images
* Hugging Face Transformers: A repository of pre-trained NLP models
* Test casesThe project comes with a set of test images that can be used to check the performance of the tool.
* You can find the test images at this link - https://github.com/example/images.

## Future improvementsImplement a more sophisticated algorithm for generating captions
* Improve the user interface for a better user experience
* Deploy the tool to a cloud server for better accessibility
